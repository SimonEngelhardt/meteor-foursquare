meteor-foursquare
=================

Foursquare API package. Only handles the OAuth flow (in conjunction with [accounts-foursquare](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/accounts-foursquare)) for now, but could be extended to do actual API things.

## Credits

Closely based on the github package introduced in Meteor 0.6.4
