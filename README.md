meteor-foursquare
=================

Foursquare API package. Only handles the OAuth flow (in conjunction with [accounts-foursquare](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/accounts-foursquare)) for now, but could be extended to do actual API things.

**Currently awaiting merge of [this pull request](https://github.com/pius/meteor-accounts-foursquare/pull/1) to accounts-foursquare and subsequent publishing to Atmosphere before everything will be in place. In the meantime, you could use [my fork](https://github.com/SimonEngelhardt/meteor-accounts-foursquare).**

## Credits

Closely based on the github package introduced in Meteor 0.6.4
