meteor-foursquare
=================

Foursquare API package. Only handles the OAuth flow (in conjunction with [accounts-foursquare](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/accounts-foursquare)) for now, but could be extended to do actual API things.

**Currently awaiting merge of pull request to [accounts-foursquare](https://github.com/pius/meteor-accounts-foursquare) before everything will be in place on Atmosphere**

## Credits

Closely based on the github package introduced in Meteor 0.6.4
